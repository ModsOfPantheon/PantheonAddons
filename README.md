# Pantheon Addons
This project is an **experimental, third party, unofficial addon API** for Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen. Its primary purpose is to create addons in the game via a readonly API which alter or create user interface objects. It is designed to blend in with the overall design of the native user interface, enhancing the game without breaking immersion.

As this project is in early development, expect breaking API changes, bugs etc.

## Installation
Install MelonLoader, following along with their [installation instructions](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=requirements)
When selecting a version to install, tick `Enable Nightly builds` and install the latest nightly build (0.7.1-ci.2207 at time of writing)
Once you're finished, run the game once as normal to allow MelonLoader to generate the required libraries. Once this is done, close the game.

This project relies on libraries generated by MelonLoader. It expects to find them in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pantheon Rise of the Fallen\MelonLoader` in the `net6` and `Il2CppAssemblies` folders. If you have installed Pantheon to a different directory you will need to resolve these references in your IDE.

This repository contains 3 projects. Once the solution is built, the following DLLs will be present in the build folder:
* `PantheonAddonLoader.dll`, which goes in the `/mods` directory in your game installation.
* `PantheonAddonFramework.dll`, which goes in the `/userlibs` directory.
* Optionally `PantheonAddons.dll`, which goes in `%APPDATA%\PantheonAddons`. This contains example addons.

The projects contain Post build events, which assume you're running the Steam version of the game, and that the game is installed to the default Steam path `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pantheon Rise of the Fallen`.

https://github.com/ModsOfPantheon/PantheonAddons/blob/master/PantheonAddons/PantheonAddons.csproj#L14

Depending on where the source code is located, the project may fail to resolve the dependency libraries. You'll need to remove all library references and re-add them at the correct path.

## Developing addons
Create a new C# library project targeting **.NET 6**
In your project, reference the PantheonAddonFramework library from this repository.
Once you've built your project, place it in `%APPDATA\PantheonAddons`. The loader will automatically find your addon class and load it to the game.

This project makes use of Github's [Wiki](https://github.com/ModsOfPantheon/PantheonAddons/wiki) feature. Code snippets and documents for developing addons are maintained there.
